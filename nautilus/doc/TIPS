Modems do not connect:

   if the modems do not connect but stay whistling and making ugly
   noise, try to add this command to the modem init string.
 
   at+ms=11,1,14400,38400 

   It makes the modem not to try "V fast Connects" but only "V34".
   This is also valid with 56K modems, as 56k is not possible 
   between two modems, but only with a special peer device. 56k
   modems fall back to V34.
